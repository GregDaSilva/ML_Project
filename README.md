Hand-drawn symbol/shape classification
The idea is to create a system that can take hand-drawn pictures and predict what is being drawn. 
The pictures were created by drawing shapes digitally on a tablet and they depict 5 shapes: Triangles, Squares, Rectangles, Circles and Diamonds.
The problem was simplified by:
• Not classifying in real-time.
• Choosing simple shapes rather than more complex drawings.
• Limiting the number of possible shapes to ease data collection and problem complexity. We chose five different ’classes’ of drawing.
